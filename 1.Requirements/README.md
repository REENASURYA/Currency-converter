## **Introduction**

**Research**

-   Currency as a monetary system based on the exchange of symbolic units, is about 4,000 years old, originating in Mesopotamia.
-   Coins specifically were in use from about 600-700 BCE. They seem to have   started around the same time in Anatolia (modern day Turkey), India and China, and spread very rapidly throughout the intervening empires during the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.
-   Later on, currency became powerful as a medium of exchange for goods.
-   Every country has its own currency.
-   The demand and supply of its currency in the foreign currency markets determines the exchange rates. It changes day to day.
-   Remembering such a big number of currencies and converting them into other currencies manually is a tedious task
-   Hence a project that makes all these conversions immediately available will be a welcoming choice.
